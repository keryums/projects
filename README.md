An assortment of mini-projects I've worked on:

### Projects:  
* `is_grad_school_making_me_fat.ipynb`(is_grad_school_making_me_fat.ipynb) contains an R-based time series analyis of weight fluctations for n = Ong subjects.
* `vet_suicide_dataviz.ipynb`(veteran_suicuide/vet_suicide_dataviz.ipynb) is an exploratory analysis into veteran suicide rates and VA expenditure data 

### Code chunks:  
* `crop_faces.ipynb`(crop_faces.ipynb) takes headshots from an input folder and for each headshot, identifies the face, crops the image around the face, and writes out the cropped image to an output folder.
